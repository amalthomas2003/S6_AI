
*Crypt arithmetic Problem*


Use permutations from itertool module

strategy : bruteforce



extract all unique letters from the input
assign all different permutation of digits to those letters


replace the letter in original strig with corresoponding digits


(NB : if 0 is assigned as the first digit of a string, skip it as 012 is considered as 12 
 (as the first digit allows for different answers, and is valid...but to adhere to rule of arithmetics i avoided it in this code)

check if addition generate required output
if not generate new set of permutation until addition of operands gives result
